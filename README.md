# Example_Abstraction
Abstraction in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
Overview:
This project demonstrates the principles of Abstraction in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) by implementing custom interfaces and standard interfaces in C#. The key objective is to illustrate how abstraction helps in hiding the internal implementation details of a class from the user, allowing the user to interact with only the necessary details. This is achieved through the use of interfaces which define method prototypes without providing their implementation.

The project consists of two main parts:

Custom Interfaces: Creating an interface to define a set of methods for various computations and implementing those methods in a class.
Standard Interfaces: Implementing standard interfaces like ICloneable to demonstrate the use of pre-defined interfaces for object cloning.
Key Concepts:
Custom Interfaces:

An interface defines method signatures (without implementation) that classes can implement.
Example: IAreaVolume interface defines methods for calculating areas and volumes (such as ComputeCircleArea, ComputeSphereVolume, etc.).
The AreaVolume class implements the IAreaVolume interface and provides actual computations.
Standard Interfaces:

Standard interfaces like ICloneable are provided by .NET to allow for common functionality like cloning objects.
The Student class implements the ICloneable interface to create a deep copy of student objects.
Features of the Project:
IAreaVolume Interface:

Defines methods for computing areas and volumes (e.g., ComputeCircleArea, ComputeRectangleArea, etc.).
The AreaVolume class implements these methods to calculate values based on given inputs.
ICloneable Interface:

Implements the Clone() method to create copies of Student objects.
Handles issues of reference types, ensuring deep copying of object fields, such as arrays and nested objects.
Demonstrates the importance of deep cloning and the use of MemberwiseClone for shallow copying.
Project Implementation:
Custom Interfaces:

An interface IAreaVolume is created with methods like ComputeCircleArea, ComputeSphereVolume, etc.
A class AreaVolume implements this interface and provides actual calculations for the methods.
A form with a button (btnTestAreaVolume) triggers these computations and displays the result.
Standard Interfaces:

The Student class is created to represent a student with properties like name, ID, and test scores.
The class implements the ICloneable interface, allowing objects to be cloned with a deep copy.
A button (btnTestICloneable) is provided to test object cloning, showing how changes in the original object do not affect the cloned object.
The class also includes a nested Address class, demonstrating how to handle cloning for fields that are reference types.
Learning Objectives:
Understand the concept of Abstraction and how it is implemented using interfaces.
Learn how to define custom interfaces for specific computations (like area and volume calculations).
Explore the usage of standard interfaces like ICloneable for common functionalities such as object cloning.
Gain insights into shallow vs deep cloning in C# and how to properly clone complex objects that contain reference types.
Technologies Used:
C#: Programming language for implementing the interfaces and classes.
Visual Studio: Integrated Development Environment (IDE) used to create the project and test the functionality.
.NET Framework: Standard library providing essential interfaces like ICloneable.
Conclusion:
This project emphasizes the importance of abstraction in software design. By using interfaces, it demonstrates how we can hide complex logic and provide simple, clear methods for end users to interact with. Additionally, the project highlights the practical applications of cloning in C#, ensuring developers can manage memory and object states efficiently. This approach to abstraction and interface design can significantly enhance code maintainability and scalability in real-world applications.![Screenshot (304)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3d88a022-ab4d-41b6-b7ce-58b35169993c)
